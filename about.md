## Hello & Welcome! Let me introduce myself...

### Who am I?

My name is Ivana Biuk. I am 26 and i come from a beautiful small country called Croatia. Currently living in Bayern, Germany. I am creative, open minded and friendly peroson. Designing is my hobby. From sketching to web design. Creativity and organisation combined equals a perfect job for me! I am determined to change my profession and to dive into the tech world.

### How did i choose tech?

After few experiences in different professions i realised that i don´t want to work a job without a passion. My proffesion is administrative officer and while i like to organize things i want something more flexible. I also want to be able to use my talents in my work. From the childhood i am interested in tech but my path took me in another direction. As i can not do my profession where i currently live i decided it´s time to shift that and have a job of the future! 

### Why TEA Academy?

Among many academies Tech Expert Academy interested me from a first look on their web page. Colors, design and a clean look of page as well as accessibility of information put a trust in me and i decided to apply to this academy. Timing of Courses and paying offers are amazing and i feel safe to grow with them. I hope the academy will put their trust in me too, and give me a chance to change my life from ROOTS!
